          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that focuses on
          periods of focus with frequent short breaks in between.
          <br />
          <br />
          1. Get a to-do list and a timer.
          <br />
          2. Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the
          timer rings.
          <br />
          3. When your round ends, you'll see the timer change color!
          <br />
          4. Then enjoy a five-minute break.
          <br />
          5. After four rounds, take a longer, more restorative 40 minute break.
          <br />
          <br />
          The technique works best when you: find small distractions derail the
          workday, have lots of open ended work that can take unlimited amounts
          of time, or enjoy a gamified goal-setting.

          Our app combines a sleek look with features such as a to-do list, a

          customize the time intervals! ‚è≤

          <br />
          The main feature of our app is the Pomodoro Timer! Underneath it are
          three buttons, allowing you to reset the current round you are on,
          play/pause the timer, skip to the next round respectively. The
          progress bar underneath the buttons keeps track of your current round
          in the session.
          <br />
          <br />
          Clicking on the settings page allows you to customize the intervals for the timer and 
          you can also mute the notification sound for the timer!
